\noindent University life
especially for first-year students, involves several 
challenges, including managing academic timetables, 
finding study resources, locating buildings in the campus, 
and builing connections between students. In order to address these 
issues, USTH Connect, an integrated University 
Life Assistant and Student Networking App, 
was developed. This Android application utilizing the advanced technologies to improve access to academic calendars, 
study materials, and campus' buildings navigation, 
while also encouraging connections 
via the innovative StudyBuddy function. 
By utilizing the K-modes clustering model, the app will pair students with compatible study partners and enables communication through secure 
Linphone-powered VoIP audio calls and instant messaging.\\

\noindent In addition, we also use a centralized PostgreSQL database for data storage, data security and manage device's communication via Tailscale VPN. The software 
includes Google Calendar, MapBox, and Moodle, 
allowing for real-time updates, 
easier navigation, and fast resource access. 
USTH Connect aims to improve the university 
experience by simplifying academic tasks and 
encouraging contact between students. This report focuses 
on the application's design, development, and implementation, 
demonstrating how it solves issues while improving 
efficiency and connectivity in the academic 
environment.\\
