\noindent Navigating university life, 
especially for first-year students, involves several 
challenges, including managing academic timetables, 
finding study resources, locating campus services, 
and building social connections. To address these 
issues, USTH Connect, an integrated University 
Life Assistant and Student Networking App, 
was developed. We uses cutting-edge 
technology in Android application to improve access to academic calendars, 
study materials, and campus navigation, 
while also encouraging social connections 
via the innovative StudyBuddy function. 
Through the use of the K-modes clustering model, 
USTH Connect enables communication through secure 
Linphone-powered VoIP conversations and messaging 
while connecting students with suitable study partners.\\

\noindent In this project, we also provides robust data protection
using a centralized PostgreSQL database and secure 
communication via Tailscale VPN. The software 
includes Google Calendar, MapBox, and Moodle, 
allowing for real-time notifications, 
smooth navigation, and fast resource access. 
For both students and administrators, 
USTH Connect aims to improve the university 
experience by simplifying academic tasks and 
encouraging social contact. This report focuses 
on its design, development, and implementation, 
demonstrating how it solves issues while improving 
efficiency and connectivity in the academic 
environment.\\
