\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Context and Motivation}
University students face many challenges, especially in their first year. Managing academic schedules, finding campus locations, accessing study materials, and forming social connections can be overwhelming.
While some universities provide tools to help, these systems are often fragmented and difficult to use. \\

Around the world, many existing apps have already addressed specific student needs. 
For example, Google Calendar helps with scheduling, Moodle provides lecture resources, Google Maps assists with navigation, and Google Classroom helps managing assignments and course updates.
However, these tools work separately and do not provide a single platform that connects academics, social life, and campus navigation.
While Google Calendar does not help students connect with peers, Google Maps lacks academic support, and Moodle and Google Classroom do not offer campus navigation or social networking features.
This seperation makes it harder for students to handle everything in one place. \\

To overcome these challenges, we developed USTH Connect, an integrated University Life Assistant and Student Networking Application. 
USTH Connect is built with the goal of supporting students' university life by combining modern yet simple technologies into an Android application, providing students with effortless access to the schedules, study materials and study location addresses.
Not only does it support their studies, it also encourages more connections between students, supporting them in their social life. That helps them to create more quality and meaningful relationships in the future.
With StudyBuddy, students can find compatible study partners, chat, and even make audio calls through secure VoIP functionality powered by Linphone.
To support the StudyBuddy features, we apply the K-modes model to help students find compatible people in the university.
USTH Connect uses a secure PostgreSQL database to manage data centrally, ensuring both protection and efficiency.\\

Below is an illustration showing how USTH Connect connects to the other products mentioned above: 
\begin{figure}[H]

\section{Requirement Analysis}
Ensuring and following the initial targets set for the project, we must be carefully analyzed the system
architecture and and implemented clear methodologies and procedures. Below is a detailed description of our approach.

\subsection{System requirements}
This section outlines the essential requirements for the development and successful operation of USTH Connect, classified into functional, non-functional, and desired functionalities.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
The functional requirements specify the primary operations and features of USTH Connect to meet student and system objectives:  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Authenticate and Authorize:} Implement secure student authentication using JWT-based tokens and role-based access control (RBAC) for managing access permissions.  
    \item \textbf{Integrate with Google Calendar:} Enable users to sync, view, and manage academic schedules in real-time within the application.  
    \item \textbf{Match with StudyBuddy:} Allow students to find study partners based on shared academic interests, goals, and compatibility through machine learning algorithms.  
    \item \textbf{Access Moodle Resources:} Provide seamless access to course materials, including slides, assignments, and reference documents, fetched directly from Moodle.  
    \item \textbf{Send Real-time Notifications:} Notify users promptly about calendar updates, study partner incoming communication, and scheduled events.  
    \item \textbf{Display Map and Navigation:} Integrate MapBox to display campus maps, building locations, and navigation features for easy campus exploration.  
    \item \textbf{Enable Communication Features:} Facilitate text-based chatting and VoIP audio calls using Linphone for seamless interaction between users.  
    \item \textbf{Provide Administrative Tools:} Offer reporting tools for administrators to monitor student engagement, system usage.  
\end{itemize} 

\pagebreak

\subsubsection{Non-functional Requirements}
The non-functional requirements outline the system's essential performance, reliability, and usability standards. While official testing has not yet been carried out, the following testing are planned to validate each requirement:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The system should support a moderate increase in student numbers and data while maintaining acceptable performance levels. 
    To perform test on the increase of users, we plan to use Apache JMeter or Locust to simulate growth usage, scaling up to around 130\% of the current user load. 
    These tests will focus on some important functionalities like schedule retrieval and display for each major, resources view, and StudyBuddy matching, in order to verify that performance of the application is stable and working well with a 30\% increase in user numbers.

    \item \textbf{Security:} User data must be protected with basic encryption protocols, secure database practices (PostgreSQL). 
    To test the security of the system, we plan to use OWASP ZAP to perform penetration testing and security audits. 
    By taking advantages of the tools, we will simulate attacks, such as SQL injection and data interception, will be held to analyze and identify upcoming potential vulnerabilities to the system.
    These tests will focus on the robust security of sensitive information and how the system will act when facing against unauthorized access attempts.

    \item \textbf{Availability:} The system should aim for an uptime of at least 90\%, ensuring minimal disruption to student access. 
    To validate this, we plan to perform tests which involve of simulating a situation like a high user usage and resource demand during peak usage times.
    By using automated tools and performing a test around 30 days, we will check for the stability of the system behavior and uptime in these specific scenarios.
    These tests will ensure to meet the target uptime we mention above and to maintain the reliable access for users.

    \item \textbf{Performance:} Key functionalities, such as schedule retrieval and StudyBuddy matching, should respond within 5 seconds under normal conditions. 
    To verify this, we plan to take advantages of libraries like Microbenchmark and Macrobenchmark to simulate the performance benchmarking. 
    By dividing into different levels of concurrent user (e.g., 10, 50, and 100 users), we will apply the test for each levels to observe response time for these key features.
    The goal is to ensure that the response time will be around 5 seconds for at least 90\% of all functionalities during typical and crowded conditions.

    \item \textbf{Usability:} The interface should be straightforward and functional, providing a smooth experience on most Android devices. 
    To test the usability, we plan to perform with a sample group of students who will be asked perform common tasks, such as retrieving schedules, acessing resources, and finding StudyBuddies. 
    Then through surveys and interviews, we can collect the feedback which will be used to identify areas for improvement. 
    The goal is for at least 80\% of participants to feel satisfied with the interface and find it functional and easy for them to use.

    \item \textbf{Maintainability:} Updates and feature additions should be feasible without causing significant downtime or compatibility issues. 
    To test the maintainability of the system, we plan to simulate updates in a controlled development environment. This involve introducing new features or patches while performing all the above testing to ensure that all functionalities are working as expected.
    During the maintenance, we will also observe the update process for any potential errors, such as compatibility errorso or longer downtime. 
    These tests will verify that the updates can be applied correctly with minimal interruption.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Desired Functionalities}
These functionalities are not critical but aim to enhance the overall student experience and system capabilities:  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Personalized Dashboard:} Provide a customizable home screen with quick access to frequently used features, such as schedules, notifications, and StudyBuddy matches.  
    \item \textbf{Event Reminders:} Enable automated reminders for upcoming deadlines, meetings, and academic events.  
    \item \textbf{Offline Mode:} Allow limited functionality, such as viewing previously synced schedule, campus location and resources link, when the student is offline.  
    \item \textbf{User Feedback System:} Incorporate feedback and rating mechanisms for StudyBuddy matches and overall app experience.  
    \item \textbf{Cross-platform Compatibility:} Develop future support for IOS devices and web browsers to expand student accessibility.  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Backend - Spring Boot}
We build our backend with Spring Boot, a Java framework that streamlines development. 
The backend manages student authentication, processes data from third-party services, and supplies APIs for the mobile app. 
It connects with Google Calendar, Mapbox, and Moodle so that schedule events, campus maps, and lecture resources stay current. 
We securely store student data and enforce user roles using JWT and RBAC, ensuring students access only the features they’re permitted to use.

\subsubsection{Mobile Frontend - Java (Android)}
We develop the mobile app in Java for Android to serve as the system’s user interface. 
The app lets students view events from Google Calendar, explore campus maps via Mapbox, and access academic resources from Moodle. 
It retrieves the latest data from the backend through APIs. 
The app also includes the StudyBuddy feature, which helps students find study partners based on their interests and habits, and it supports real-time audio and messaging with Linphone VoIP. 
This user-friendly interface connects students seamlessly to the system’s features.

\subsubsection{Machine Learning - K-modes Clustering}
We power the StudyBuddy feature with a Python-based machine learning model that uses the K-modes clustering algorithm to group students by personality traits, hobbies, learning styles, and academic goals. 
When students submit their details, we send the data to the backend, where the model groups similar students and recommends study partners through the mobile app.

There are many advantages for why Python was chosen over Java for the implementation of the machine learning model in our system architecture. First, the libraries which are designed specifically for machine learning configuration are offered by Python, such as (Add used libraries). These libraries provide powerful and optimized tools for implementing our algorithm which is K-modes clustering, fostering faster development and experimentation.
Regarding Java, it lacks various of tools which directly support the implementation process and require more complex and custom implementations. Additionally, Python provides direct support for the K-modes clustering algorithm through the kmodes library, which is a key reason why we choose Python over Java in the implementation of the machine learning model.
As regards to the process of prototyping and experimentation, which is significant for fine-tuning machine learning models, Python allows a faster and short duration for this process. Finally, Python integrates seamlessly with the backend services, ensuring easy communication with other system components through APIs.
In conclusion, Python is considered as the most suitable choice for implementing the required machine Learning model which plays a crucial role in the StudyBuddy feature.

\subsubsection{Communication - Linphone VoIP}
We integrate Linphone, an open-source VoIP library, to enable real-time audio calls between matched students. 
Once the StudyBuddy feature pairs students, they can communicate directly through the app without relying on external services. 
Linphone helps foster collaboration and interaction among students by providing a reliable voice communication platform.

\subsubsection{How Does The System Work?}
This system combines multiple components to work well together.
The Spring Boot backend serves as the brain of the operation, managing user accounts, data storage, and communication with external services like Google Calendar, Mapbox, Moodle, and Linphone VoIP library.
The mobile app, built with Java, communicates with the backend to access real-time information. To connect students with similar interests, the system employs a smart matching algorithm (using Python). 
Once matched, students can easily make voice calls within the app thanks to Linphone's built-in calling feature. \\

The mobile app uses REST APIs to send requests to the backend and receive responses for features like schedules, campus navigation, learning material, and StudyBuddy matches. 
The backend connects to the PostgreSQL databases through JPA, which simplifies database interaction by using ORM.
This allows the backend to retrieve, update, and store data, such as user profiles, schedules, and course materials, through entities and repositories.
When necessary, the backend also interacts with external services like Google Calendar, MapBox, Moodle, and Linphone VoIP through their APIs to fetch or synchronize required information.
This structured communication ensures all components can work together, provide accurate and real-time data to the users.\\

The mobile app depends on the backend for up-to-date information, while the backend uses the database and external services to ensure smooth operations.
In summary, this system provides students with a comprehensive platform that support their academic needs and encourages better communication and collaboration.

\section{Clustering Model for Recommendation}
K-Mode clustering algorithm is an unsupervised model that applies the same method as K-Means clustering but with a different approach to distance measurement. Instead of using mean to group data points, K-Mode uses mode (the highest frequent value) to separate categorical data effectively.

\subsection{K-Mode Algorithm}
The dissimilarity measure between two categorical objects X and Y (with m attributes) can be defined by the total mismatches of their corresponding categorical attributes. The two objects X and Y are considered to be more similar when the value of a mismatched number gets smaller.\citep{huang1998extensions}
        $$d(X,Y) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}\delta{(x_i,y_i)}$$ where $$\delta{(x_i,y_i)} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 0 & (x_i = y_i) \\
        1 & (x_i \neq y_i)\end{array}\right.$$

\vspace{0.5cm}

% Cost function
Let $\{Q_1,Q_2,...,Q_k\}$ be the modes of clusters $\{C_1,C_2,...,C_k\}$. The cost function can be defined by taking the total dissimilarities of each sample and its assigned cluster's mode\citep{huang1998extensions}: 
$$E = \sum_{l=1}^{k}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i,l}d(X_i,Q_l)$$ 
where $y_{i,l}$ is a binary indicator variable (1 if $X_i$ refers to cluster l, 0 otherwise), k is the number of clusters, n is the total number of samples, $d(X_i,Q_l)$ is the dissimilarity between sample $X_i$ and the mode $Q_l$. The objective is to minimize the value of the cost function by following the following steps: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Randomly select K initial modes as K clusters.
    
    \item Calculate the dissimilarity between data points and the mode of each cluster. Then assign objects to the cluster whose mode is closest to it (which has the smallest dissimilarity). Update the cluster’s mode by selecting the highest frequency of each category within the cluster. If there are more than 2 categories of an attribute that have the same highest frequency, we randomly select one of them to serve as mode.
    
    \item Recalculate the dissimilarity of objects with the current modes and reassign the object to the cluster with closest mode and update the new modes for clusters.
    
    \item Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until every cluster has no changes after testing the whole dataset.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{One-Hot Encoding}\label{one-hot-enc}
One-hot Encoding is a data preprocess method to change text format to numerical data type so that the machine can understand and process the data. It transforms a variable with $n$ distinct categories into $n$ separate columns as new features. Each column is represented by two numbers: 0 and 1. The value 1 indicates the presence of a category, while the value 0 shows its absence.\citep{thuy2020optimize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics} \label{evaluation metrics}
This part covers the intrinsic evaluation metrics that be used to evaluate model performance. Moreover, these metrics are also used to determine the appropriate number of clusters.

\subsubsection{Silhouette Coefficient}

\noindent Choosing the optimal number of k value is crucial for the 
K-mode algorithm. To study the optimal value of k for a clustering algorithm, 
various methods have been proposed. While the ground truth is not available
in a data set, intrinsic methods should be used to evaluate the 
clustering quality. These methods will examining how well the clusters
are separated or compacted together \citep{2012vi}. Silhouette Coefficient is one of the most
commonly used intrinsic methods, which measures the quality of a cluster. The highest
silhouette score calculated by the mean silhouette coefficient of all samples
is considered the optimal number of clusters \citep{9260048}. \\

\noindent With a dataset D of n objects, in which D is partitioned into 
k clusters, $\{C_1,C_2,...,C_k\}$. For each object $o \in D$, 
let $a(o)$ be the average distance of o to all other objects in the same cluster.
Similarly, let $b(o)$ be the minimum average distance of o to other clusters.
Suppose $o \in C_i(1 \leq i \leq k )$, then \citep{2012vi}: 

$$a(o) = \frac{\sum_{o' \in C_i , o \neq o'} dist(o,o')}{|C_i| - 1}$$
and
$$b(o) = \min_{C_j: 1 \leq j \leq k, j \neq i} \frac{\sum_{o' \in C_j} dist(o,o')}{|C_j|}$$

The silhouette coefficient of object o is defined as:
$$s(o) = \frac{b(o) - a(o)}{\max\{a(o),b(o)\}}$$

\noindent The silhouette coefficient is in $[-1,1]$. The $a(o)$ value illustrated
the compactness of the cluster which o belongs. Smaller $a(o)$ means the
cluster is more compact. The $b(o)$ value shows how well-separated the 
cluster o is from other clusters. Larger $b(o)$ means the cluster is
more separated. When the silhouette coefficient is close to 1, it indicates
that the object $o$ is compact and distance to others. On the other hand, 
if the silhouette coefficient is close to -1 (i.e., $a(o) > b(o)$), means
the object $o$ is far from its cluster and close to other clusters. This is
the reason why a larger silhouette coefficient is considered better in terms of
clustering quality. 


\subsubsection{Davies-Bouldin Index}

\noindent Another evaluation metric that can be used to evaluate
the clustering quality is the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI). The DBI
is calculated by the average similarity between each cluster and its
most similar cluster. The lower the DBI value, the better the clustering
quality. The DBI is defined as follows \citep{HOSEN2023688}:
\begin{center}

$ DBI = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} max_{j \neq i} \frac{s_i + s_j}{d(c_i,c_j)}$

\end{center}
and
\begin{center}
$s_i = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} d(x_j,c_i)$
\end{center}
\noindent In which $n$ is the number of clusters, $s_i$ is the average distance between
each data point belonging to cluster $i$ and the centroid of cluster $i$, 
$d(c_i,c_j)$ indicated the distance between the centroids of cluster $i$ and
$j$.

    \end{tabular} 
    \caption{Selected features for K-Mode clustering model} 
\end{table}

The features that be used as input data for the model are chosen manually. Since all selected features are categorical, they need to be pre-processed before fed into the model (which will be described in the next part).

\subsubsection{Data Preprocessing}
The input data is processed by applying one-hot encoding method. In the beginning, the student's data has been converted into a dense binary array before being used as input for the machine learning model. Moreover, since each student has to provide their information before having permission to use this application (choose at least one category for each attribute \emph{(Interests, Favorite Subject,...)}), there are no missing data in our dataset. These tables below show the example for the data preprocessing part:

\begin{table}[H]
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Major} & \textbf{Interests} & ... & \textbf{Favorite Subject} \\ \hline
DS & V-pop, Volleyball, Board games & ... & Calculus, Linear Algebra, Artificial Intelligence \\ \hline
ICT & EDM, Board games, DIY, Movie, Netflix & ... & Calculus, Chemistry, Programming \\ \hline
ICT & Football, Cooking, Food tour, Travel, Rap & ... & Programming \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
}
\caption{Data before preprocessing}

1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & ... & 0 \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & ... & 1 \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & ... & 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
}
\caption{Data after preprocessing}
\label{data preprocessing}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Model Training}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{image/choosing_K.png}
    \caption{Optimal clusters K}
    \label{fig:choosing_K}
\end{figure}

To determine the optimal number of clusters $K$, the K-Modes clustering model is trained with different K values varying from 2 to 9 and select the best model according to the cost function. For each training iteration, the K-Modes algorithm is executed multiple times (15 in our problem) with different initial centroids seeds. The final result is the best initialized centroids in terms of cost function.\citep{devos2015}\\

After the training is completed, each student is assigned to their predicted cluster, which will be used for the recommendation part.\\

Performance of the model will be discussed in the Results section. We will show both strengths and limitations of our approach and compare the performance with the same method on different dataset.

\subsubsection{Student Recommendation}
Firstly, the information of new student is encoded by one-hot encoding and fed into the model. The output returned is the predicted cluster to which the new student belongs. Depending on this prediction, students within the same cluster are chosen to recommend.

\section{System Design and Implementation}  
This section explains how we set up the system, covering hardware and software configurations and initial testing.
\subsection{Hardware and Software Setup}  
We set up development machines to host backend services and the PostgreSQL database. 
Students use Android smartphones or emulators to access features like schedule views, campus navigation, and Moodle resources. 
We also run our backend and database on Windows and the mobile app on Android and choose PostgreSQL to manage student data, calendar events, location details, and StudyBuddy information. 
Additionally, we use Spring Boot to handle REST API endpoints, authentication, and data synchronization, while we develop the mobile app in Android Studio with Java, using libraries such as Retrofit and MapBox SDK.

\subsection{Application Software} 
The application was divided into several modules, as each of them serve a specific feature.
The Authentication and Authorization Module implemented JWT-based authentication and managed RBAC for ADMIN and USER roles.
The Google Calendar Integration Module was responsible for fetching event data, detecting updates, and notifying students about changes.
The MapBox Integration Module enabled storage of campus's study places coordinates and overall campus map viewing. \\

Regarding Moodle Resource Module, we set up a communication with Moodle APIs to retrieve course materials such as slides, source code, and PDFs.
About StudyBuddy Matching Module, we implemented a machine learning recommendation system to suggest matches based on shared interests, collecting student profile data and offering text-based chat and SIP-based VoIP audio call using the Linphone library.
The Notification System provided real-time alerts for calendar updates and incoming calls.

\subsection{Initial Testing}
We conducted hardware, software, and integration tests. 
Initially, we checked development machines, servers, and network performance. 
Then, we verified the Windows setup on backend machines and tested PostgreSQL with sample data and CRUD operations. 
Next, we tested Spring Boot REST API endpoints with Postman to confirm JWT authentication and proper functionality. 
During integration tests, we simulated dummy events to check Google Calendar synchronization, verified campus coordinates with MapBox, and confirmed Moodle API communication by simulating course material uploads. 
We also tested the StudyBuddy matching with sample profiles, and we checked text chat and SIP-based VoIP audio calls using Linphone. 
Finally, we simulated calendar updates and incoming calls to ensure notifications appear correctly. 
Together, these tests confirm that the system works reliably and is ready for deployment.

\section{Results and Discussion}
This section focus on the results and discuss the outcome of the USTH Connect project, focusing on key aspects such as model performance, application development progress, and challenges we encounter during the development.
\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Mobile App Results}
In this part we will show the result of the application developement, mainly about what we have developed so far and some specific results of the application. \\

\textbf{Application Features Progress} \\

The USTH Connect mobile application has made significant progress in its development, results in successful implementation of several features.
Apart from the configuration of login and registration system using JWT authentication and RBAC, we manage to develop a functions for synchronizing calendar events with the school's Google Calendar.
In our application, we have displayed the schedule according to the student's major and study year to save student effort finding the correct schedule. 
Moreover, students can view all the lectures events for a specific subject. Also, the system periodically fetchs events and detects event changes to notify the students about their schedule.
We have configured a map feature using MapBox SDK to display campus maps with location markers for each buildings and facilities which supports student efficiently navigate within the university.
Regarding lecture resources, we have successfully linked the application to Moodle, allowing students to retrieve and view course materials directly from the app.
For the main feature StudyBuddy, we have developed a recommendation system using machine learning model. By retrieving student's data, we can successfully return and display a list of compatible partners for students to enrich their social life.
The app provides a chat platform and audio call using Linphone VoIP library for real-time communication between matched students. Especially, the audio call has been improved with real-time connection and notifications. 
However, the chat platform yet does not have a notification for incoming messages and more appealing UI for better application experience.
Also, we have not figure out an efficient way to store the image to support Study Buddy feature in displaying images for each users. \\

\textbf{Mobile-Specific Results} \\

We tested across a variety of devices (emulator and Android) and the performance was consistent, with the two main factors: App Launch Time and Network Usage. The average app launch time was 2 seconds on Android devices and 4 seconds on Emulator devices. The app also optimized data usage by caching schedule events, map location and course materials, which partly reduce a dependency on continuous internet access for those features. 
By combining many features of other applications into one, USTH Connect offer students an efficient tool. This eliminates the need for multiple applications, saving students time and enhancing their overall experience.

\subsubsection{Machine Learning Results}
In this part we will show the result of the clustering algorithm, using the evaluation of
metrics that we mentioned in the previous section. \\

\textbf{Model Performance} \\

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\resizebox{0.7\textwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Silhouette Score} & \textbf{Davies-Bouldin Score} \\ \hline
K-Modes & 0.1389 & 3.4489 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
}
\caption{Model Performance}
\label{Model_Performance}
\end{table}

Table \ref{Model_Performance} presents the values of the Silhouette and Davies-Bouldin score. The silhouette score indicates how close the data point is to its cluster compared to the others, while the Davies-Bouldin score shows how high the overall quality of the clustering model. With a Silhouette score of 0.1389 and a Davies-Bouldin score of 3.4489, the centroids of each cluster are relatively close to each other, and the boundaries between clusters may not be ideal.\\

The same pre-processing method and K-Modes model is also applied to the Zoo dataset (with true label) and gives the result: 0.5362 of Silhouette Score and 1.21 of Davies-Bouldin Score. The Kuhn-Munkres\citep{zhu2011efficient} algorithm is used to match predicted clusters with the true types of animals to maximize accuracy. This performance is notably better than the results obtained in our dataset. The possible reason for this may be the higher dimensionality of the input data in our dataset, which can increase noise and complexity for clustering.\\ 

\textbf{Similar System} \\

The same pre-preocessing method and K-Modes model is applied to the Zoo dataset (with true label) and gives the result: 0.5362 of Silhouette Score and 1.21 of Davies-Bouldin Score. The Kuhn-Munkres\citep{zhu2011efficient} algorithm is used to match the predicted clusters with the true types of animals to maximize accuracy.

\subsection{Discussion}
\subsubsection{Intepretation of Results}
The development of USTH Connect has show significant progress in creating a comprehensive mobile application designed to improve university life.
The app efficiently combines various features, including Google Calendar synchronization, campus naviation, access to Moodle resources, and the StudyBuddy recommendation system.

Although the clustering algorithm provides valuable insights into study partner compatibility, evaluation metrics indicates that the need of improvement in cluster separation and cohesion.
The low Silhouette score and high Davies-Bouldin score show the need for better feature selection or model tuning to enhance clustering performance. \\

Regarding the mobile application, fetching and caching data like schedules and course materials has dramatically enhanced usability, enabling partial offline access.
However, the lack of chat message notifications and a more optimized image storage system reduce the overall user experience.

\subsubsection{Comparison to Similar System}
Unlike traditional university assistance apps that mostly focus on course and student management or navigation, USTH Connect combines multiple features into a single application, implementing academic tools with a social networking developed by machine learning.
In contrast to other platforms which may recommend compatible groups or clubs, USTH Connect's StudyBuddy feature offers a more personalized study partner recommendation system.
In terms of user experience, many similar systems lack seamless communication methods, such as real-time audio calling with real-time notification, which is one of the features that USTH Connect offers.
However, the need of improvements in UI design and notification system to surpass other platforms.

\subsubsection{Challenges and Limitations}
Despite the progress made, the project faced serveral challenges and limitations. First, the current system for storing and retrieving student images in the StudyBuddy feature is inefficient, resulting in a poor user experience and diminishing the visual appeal of the interface. Additionally, the performance of the clustering algorithm indicates the need for further research in feature selection, parameter tuning, or exploring alternative algorithms to optimize its effectiveness. While notifications for calendar events and VoIP calls are functioning as expected, the system lacks of notifications for incoming chat messages and matched partners in the StudyBuddy feature, which needs to be addressed. Furthermore, certain sections of the app, such as the chat interface and the StudyBuddy partner profile view, require improved visual design and user-friendly features to enhance the overall user experience. About the cross-device testing problem, although the application has been tested on emulators and Android devices, broader cross-device testing is necessary to ensure compatibility across different screen sizes and operating system versions. Another critical aspect is the Moodle integration, where the app currently relies on a custom-built Moodle system rather than integrating with the official Moodle platform provided by the school. This limitation prevents synchronization with official course materials, restricting students' seamless access to academic resources and course content. Full integration with the official Moodle platform is essential to enhance the app’s functionality and provide students with comprehensive support for their academic needs.

Sections like the chat interface, the StudyBuddy profile views, and other areas will be refined to improve the overall visual and make user more engaged into our application.
To declare the problems about our user interface, user feedback play a vital role in creating these enhancement suggestion to verify a design that match the student expectations and preferences.
Additionally, optimizing the notification system will be a key improvement as it associates with many key functionalities like schedule retrieval and StudyBuddy communication features.
We will focus to enable a notification for chat features, as well as notify users about new StudyBuddy matches and importance calendar events such as Exam day or Meetings. \\

Regarding the clusteing algorithm, the current one for StudyBuddy feature will need further optimization through testing alternative methods, fine-tuning parameters, and combining additional relevant features to improve the accuracy of the recommendation. Moreover, the model performance could be improved by reducing the dimensionality of the input data and integrating deep learning for features extraction. With this integration, the model can reduce noise features while still retain the characteristics of user. After the application is running, user behaviors such as the number of likes, time spent on recommending part, and the number of connected friends will be collected for further analysis and better user experience understanding. 
Similarly, the platform compatibility and cross-device testing will be improved to ensure the application performs consistently across various screen sizes and operating systems.
