% For Android application development, Android Studio is considered as the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for app development.
% According to Google, it is recommended as an ideal IDE for Android development and have a variety of powerful features including:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{XML (Extensible Markup Language) Layout Desgin:} Android Studio offers a visual layout editor for designing user interface (UI). 
%     XML seperates the UI design from business logic, enabling multiple designers and developers to work independently. XML layouts follow a tree structure where each elements will represent a UI component.
%     Each elements will have multiple attributes (layout, styles, ID,...) and layout types (ConstraintLayout, LinearLayout,...) to help implement an eye-catching and simple UI.
%     Moreover, by binding directly the layout components to corresponding properties in the code or transforming XML into runtime object using Layout Inflation.
%     \item \textbf{Gradle Build System: } In Android Studio, Gradle will take responsibility for automatic project building and management. 
%     It will handle requirement dependencies, compiled resources, and the most important is generating

\section{AI Model Analysis and Training}
\subsection{One-Hot Encoding}
One-hot Encoding is a data preprocessing technique that transforms a single categorical variable with n distinct categories 
into n separate columns. Each column is represented by one number 0 or 1, where the value 1 presents the presence of that category 
and the value 0 indicates its absence. This method helps machine learning models, which typically require numerical input, 
better understand and handle the data.

\subsection{Dissimilarity Measure}
The dissimilarity measure between two categorical objects X and Y (with m attributes) can be defined by the total mismatches of their corresponding categorical attributes. The two objects X and Y are considered to be more similar when the value of a mismatched number gets smaller.
        $$d(X,Y) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}\delta{(x_i,y_i)}$$ where $$\delta{(x_i,y_i)} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 0 & (x_i = y_i) \\
        1 & (x_i \neq y_i)\end{array}\right.$$

\subsection{K-Mode Algorithm}
% Cost function
Let $\{Q_1,Q_2,...,Q_k\}$ be the modes of clusters $\{C_1,C_2,...,C_k\}$. The cost function can be defined by taking the total dissimilarities of each sample and its assigned cluster's mode: 
$$E = \sum_{l=1}^{k}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i,l}d(X_i,Q_l)$$ 
where $y_{i,l}$ is a binary indicator variable (1 if $X_i$ refers to cluster l, 0 otherwise), k is the number of clusters, n is the total number of samples, $d(X_i,Q_l)$ is the dissimilarity between sample $X_i$ and the mode $Q_l$. The objective is to minimize the value of the cost function by following the following steps: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Randomly select K initial modes as K clusters.
    
    \item Calculate the dissimilarity between data points and the mode of each cluster. Then assign objects to the cluster whose mode is closest to it (which has the smallest dissimilarity). Update the cluster’s mode by selecting the highest frequency of each category within the cluster. If there are more than 2 categories of an attribute that have the same highest frequency, we randomly select one of them to serve as mode.
    
    \item Recalculate the dissimilarity of objects with the current modes and reassign the object to the cluster with closest mode and update the new modes for clusters.
    
    \item Repeat Step 2 and 3 until every cluster has no changes after testing the whole dataset.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}
\subsubsubsection{Silhouette Coefficient}
\\
\noindent Choosing the optimal number of k value is crucial for the 
K-mode algorithm. To study the optimal value of k for a clustering algorithm, 
various methods have been proposed. While the ground truth is not available
in a data set, intrinsic methods should be used to evaluate the 
clustering quality. These methods will examining how well the clusters
are separated or compacted together \citep{2012vi}. Silhouette Coefficient is one of the most
commonly used intrinsic methods, which measures the quality of a cluster. The highest
silhouette score calculated by the mean silhouette coefficient of all samples
is considered the optimal number of clusters \citep{9260048}. 

\noindent With a data set D of n objects, in which D is partitioned into 
k clusters, $\{C_1,C_2,...,C_k\}$. For each object $o \in D$, 
let $a(o)$ be the average distance of o to all other objects in the same cluster.
Similarly, let $b(o)$ be the minimum average distance of o to other clusters.
Suppose $o \in C_i(1 \leq i \leq k )$, then \citep{2012vi}: 

$$a(o) = \frac{\sum_{o' \in C_i , o \neq o'} dist(o,o')}{|C_i| - 1}$$
and
$$b(o) = \min_{C_j: 1 \leq j \leq k, j \neq i} \frac{\sum_{o' \in C_j} dist(o,o')}{|C_j|}$$

The silhouette coefficient of object o is defined as:
$$s(o) = \frac{b(o) - a(o)}{\max\{a(o),b(o)\}}$$

\noindent The silhouette coefficient is in $[-1,1]$. The $a(o)$ value illustrated
the compactness of the cluster which o belongs. Smaller $a(o)$ means the
cluster is more compact. The $b(o)$ value shows how well-separated the 
cluster o is from other clusters. Larger $b(o)$ means the cluster is
more separated. When the silhouette coefficient is close to 1, it indicates
that the object $o$ is compact and distance to others. On the other hand, 
if the silhouette coefficient is close to -1 (i.e., $a(o) > b(o)$), means
the object $o$ is far from its cluster and close to other clusters. This is
the reason why a larger silhouette coefficient is considered better in terms of
clustering quality. 


\subsubsubsection{Davies-Bouldin Index}
\\
\noindent Another evaluation metric that can be used to evaluate
the clustering quality is the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI). The DBI
is calculated by the average similarity between each cluster and its
most similar cluster. The lower the DBI value, the better the clustering
quality. The DBI is defined as follows \citep{HOSEN2023688}:

$ DBI = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} max_{j \neq i} \frac{s_i + s_j}{d(c_i,c_j)}$

and 

$s_i = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} d(x_j,c_i)$

\noindent In which $n$ is the number of clusters, $s_i$ is the average distance between
each data point belonging to cluster $i$ and the centroid of cluster $i$, 
$d(c_i,c_j)$ indicated the distance between the centroids of cluster $i$ and
$j$.
